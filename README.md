### Description

Console.Log is an online platform for students and teachers to openly discuss questions and answers where data from discussions can be stored and reference can be made to it easily


### Inspiration

Many times be it in school or work, we have open discussions/conversations where there are useful data which we can refer to in future projects or exams revisions that are lost since there is usually no official note taker.


### Initialization

Fork it and type `npm run start in terminal` to load up the main page.

Alternatively, visit [Console.Log](https://qnalvis.herokuapp.com/). Hosted on Heroku.


## Features

Start By creating an account and select type as either teacher or student depending who you are.

You will then be directed to the login page, and just key in your registered username and password to begin.

You will be directed to a dashboard which serves as an overview of the current questions as well as charts to show statistics of questions, answers and topics personalized based on whether you are a student or teacher.

You can also add a question, edit and delete (only applicable to the ones you created) and even upvote or downvote the question to your liking.

Last but not least, teachers also have the added functionality to verify the best answers.
